Welcome to the BGP-DMVPN Lab with Confederation and MPLS Integration repository! This lab showcases an MPLS network running OSPF as the IGP, serving 2 customer networks. One customer network utilizes DMVPN with IPSEC over eBGP, while the other runs DMVPN with IPSEC over a BGP confederation. Please note that this lab is a work in progress.

## Lab Overview üåê

In this lab scenario, you will explore the integration of BGP, DMVPN, and MPLS technologies to create a versatile networking environment. By using a combination of OSPF, BGP, DMVPN, and IPSEC, you will gain hands-on experience configuring and troubleshooting complex network setups.
